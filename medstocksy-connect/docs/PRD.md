### 2.4 Automated Reminders (High ROI)

**Purpose:** Drive repeat purchases through timely, relevant reminders.

**Reminder Types:**

1. **Refill Reminders**
   - Trigger: Based on medicine purchase history
   - Frequency: Medicine-specific intervals
   - Example: BP medicine → 25-day reminder

2. **Follow-Up Reminders**
   - Trigger: Days since last purchase
   - Frequency: Configurable (7, 14, 30 days)
   - Example: No purchase in 30 days → "We miss you" message

3. **Custom Reminders**
   - Trigger: Manual or rule-based
   - Frequency: User-defined
   - Example: "Stock arrived for {medicine_name}"

**Custom Rules Engine:**

**Medicine-Based Mapping:**
```
Medicine Type          → Refill Interval → Reminder Offset
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
BP medicine            → 30 days        → 25 days
Diabetes medicine      → 30 days        → 25 days
Vitamins              → 60 days        → 55 days
Antibiotics           → None            → No reminder
Pain relief (as needed) → None            → No reminder
Cough syrup           → 30 days        → 25 days
```

**Rule Configuration UI:**
- Select medicine
- Set reminder interval (in days)
- Choose message template
- Enable/disable toggle

**Example Reminder Flow:**
```
1. Customer buys "Amlodipine" (BP med) on May 1
2. Auto-scheduled reminder: June 25 (25 days later)
3. On June 25 at 10 AM:
   - Check if customer already purchased
   - If not → Send WhatsApp reminder
4. Customer sees: "Time to refill your BP medicine?"
5. Customer replies or calls → Captured in timeline
```

- No multi-step modals for quick sends
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users (desktop)

### 2. No Clutter
- Hide advanced options by default
- Progressive disclosure (expandable sections)
- Clear, scannable cards
- Whitespace > density

### 3. Desktop & Mobile Compatible
- Desktop = primary (full features)
- Mobile = companion (quick actions + read-only)
- Responsive at all breakpoints
- Touch-friendly on mobile

### 4. Hindi/English Friendly (Later)

- Prepare for RTL + LTR flexibility
- Medicine names can be transliterated
- Error messages in plain language

### 5. Design System

- **Colors:** Clean, pharmacy-appropriate (blue/green)
- **Typography:** Clear hierarchy
- **Components:** Reusable, consistent
- **Forms:** Large, minimal fields
- **Buttons:** Clear primary/secondary distinction

## 4. User Flow (Core Loop)

This loop = product value. Every step must be frictionless.

```
1. BILL GENERATED
   └─ Staff completes sale at billing counter
   
2. CUSTOMER AUTO-CREATED (if new)
   └─ Phone number = primary key
   └─ No additional data entry needed
   
3. WHATSAPP BILL SENT (automatic)
   └─ Bill copy + "Thank you" message
   └─ Delivered within 30 seconds
   
4. REMINDER SCHEDULED (automatic)
   └─ Based on medicine type
   └─ E.g., BP med → 25-day reminder
   
5. CUSTOMER RETURNS
   └─ Sees bill from last purchase
   └─ Comes back for refill
   
6. REPEAT
   └─ New bill created
   └─ Cycle restarts
```

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ No manual CRM entry
- ✅ Automatic engagement (no follow-up work)
- ✅ Timely reminders (context-specific)
- ✅ Builds habit (repeat visit)
- ✅ Increases lifetime value

         automation, and WhatsApp is where customers are
```

```
"Every pharmacy customer should come back.
Medstocksy Connect reminds them automatically
no manual follow-up, no CRM learning curve.
One bill, one message, repeat customer."
